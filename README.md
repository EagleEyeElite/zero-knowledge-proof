# zero-knowledge-proof# Zero Knowledge Proof Implementation

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Schnorr Zero Knowledge Proof protocol, showing how to prove knowledge of a discrete logarithm without revealing it.

## Features

- Basic ZKP implementation using the Schnorr protocol
- Multiple round verification
- Demonstration of both successful proofs and attempted cheating
- Configurable parameters for experimentation

## Usage

```python
python main.py
```

## Example Output

```
=== Basic Zero Knowledge Proof Example ===
Secret (private key): 7
Public key: 17

Proof verified: True

=== Multiple Rounds Demonstration ===
Round 1: ✓
Round 2: ✓
Round 3: ✓
```
